-[Command, the easy state management system for new developers to start with]

-[Cubit, the easy way to use provider]

-[RiverPod, a more improved way to use provider]

-[Mobx]

## Code of Conduct

You cannot joke about something you are not as you will always goof-up on what might be funny for that person so, only joke about yourself instead. If you cannot treat them as you would treat your children, your brothers and sisters, and your parents it may be the wrong action to do towards another person.
